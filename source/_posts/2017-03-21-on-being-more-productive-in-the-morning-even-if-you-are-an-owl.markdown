Hi there! Today I want to share with you my experience of a productivity shift from the late evening/night to the morning. First let me tell you a story on how my day was structured before for countless years.

## Mornings That Start with a Lunch

A year ago and before I was pulling out late nights almost every single day. Making an open-source contribution, woring on the awesome side project idea, writing a blog post, watching a conference talk or a fun video. As an owl type, I have a lot of shiny ideas in that time of day, also, my productivity is at its top. Or at least it feels that way.

This usually meant, that I would go to work next day somewhere between 10 AM and 12 PM. Mostly, that was okay, because a lot of other developers around me did the same thing.

So, imagine having your work day (for your employer, client or yourself) start this way:

1. Come a work
2. Drink coffee and eat breakfast, because, obviously you didn't have time to do that at home
3. Chit chat with your collegaues (offline or online), go through the email inbox
4. Do some work for half an hour
5. It is a lunch time
6. Food coma for 1 hour
7. Be not-so-productive (because you're tired and an owl type) for what you have left in a day (2-4 hours)
8. Maybe pull out overtimer because stuff needs to be delivered

You can see, that my work day wasn't as productive as it should. One may say that I'm just shifting focus on my own activities and invest less productivity into the work for my employer/client/etc. And I have another story to tell here.

## A Lot of Rework

I have been noticing for some time that all the work that I do in the late evenings and in the night for myself needs to be re-worked all the time. To put it simply, quality of my most "productive" work was not as good as I would expect it to be.
