`if` statements tend to duplicate throughout the code base. This may lead to subtle mistakes and bugs. One way to avoid that problem is to eliminate `if` statement completely. Today we are going to take a look at one example of such elimination. Code examples today will be in Kotlin.

## Problem at hand

- Our API has an endpoint for issuing some sort of `verification token` given `device id` and `phone number` of the user's mobile device.
- We need to integrate these `verification tokens` with 3rd party API.
- The format of `verification token` is fairly standardized.
- After initial research, it turned out that `issuer` field of `verification token` has to be URL of the API that has issued that token and 3rd party API in question validates this fact.
- Currently, `issuer` field gets generated as `com.tddfellow`. According to this standard, it has to be `https://tddfellow.com`.
- Additionally, we have to support old versions of mobile clients for next 6 months, that are validating `issuer` to be `com.tddfellow`, we can not change them as they are already installed on users' mobile devices.

Solution: bump the version of our API from `v1` to `v2` and use `v1` for integration with old mobile clients and use `v2` for integration with 3rd party API and all new clients.

## Current Relevant Code

Main program, containing routing information:

```kotlin
// Main.kt

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val secureTokenSource = SimpleSecureTokenSource()
    val verificationTokenGateway = DummyVerificationTokenGateway()

    val issueVerificationTokenUseCase = UseCase(secureTokenSource, verificationTokenGateway)
    val issueVerificationTokenEndpoint = Endpoint(issueVerificationTokenUseCase)

    Spark.get("/api/v1/issueVerificationToken") { request, response ->
        issueVerificationTokenEndpoint.issueVerificationToken(
                deviceId = request.queryParams("deviceId"),
                phoneNumber = request.queryParams("phoneNumber")
        )
    }
}
```

Endpoint that issues verification token:

```kotlin
// ApiEndpoints/IssueVerificationToken/Endpoint.kt

class Endpoint(private val useCase: UseCase) {

    fun issueVerificationToken(deviceId: String, phoneNumber: String): IssueVerificationTokenEndpointResponse {
        val issueVerificationToken = useCase.issueVerificationToken(deviceId, phoneNumber)

        return IssueVerificationTokenEndpointResponse(
                issuer = issueVerificationToken.issuer,
                token = issueVerificationToken.secureToken
        )
    }

}
```

And the UseCase itself:

```kotlin
// IssueVerificationToken/UseCase.kt

open class UseCase(private val secureTokenSource: SecureTokenSource,
                   private val verificationTokenGateway: VerificationTokenGateway) {

    open fun issueVerificationToken(deviceId: String, phoneNumber: String): VerificationToken {
        val verificationToken = VerificationToken(
                issuer = "com.tddfellow",
                deviceId = deviceId,
                phoneNumber = phoneNumber,
                secureToken = secureTokenSource.generateToken()
        )

        verificationTokenGateway.persist(verificationToken)
        return verificationToken
    }

}
```

## Solution With Awkward `if` Statement

Easiest solution using passed in `apiVersion` from the `Main` program and switch on it being old or new in the use case to determine which issuer to generate:

```kotlin
// Main.kt

Spark.get("/api/v1/issueVerificationToken") { request, response ->
    issueVerificationTokenEndpoint.issueVerificationToken(
            deviceId = request.queryParams("deviceId"),
            phoneNumber = request.queryParams("phoneNumber"),

            // here we are passing "old" version to the endpoint
            apiVersion = "v1"
    )
}

Spark.get("/api/v2/issueVerificationToken") { request, response ->
    issueVerificationTokenEndpoint.issueVerificationToken(
            deviceId = request.queryParams("deviceId"),
            phoneNumber = request.queryParams("phoneNumber"),

            // here we are passing "new" version to the endpoint
            apiVersion = "v2"
    )
}
```

And the endpoint just passes this value through to the use case:

```kotlin
// ApiEndpoints/IssueVerificationToken/Endpoint.kt

fun issueVerificationToken(deviceId: String,
                           phoneNumber: String,
                           apiVersion: String): IssueVerificationTokenEndpointResponse {

    val issueVerificationToken = useCase.issueVerificationToken(
            deviceId = deviceId,
            phoneNumber = phoneNumber,

            // here we are passing API version through
            apiVersion = apiVersion
    )

    return IssueVerificationTokenEndpointResponse(
            issuer = issueVerificationToken.issuer,
            token = issueVerificationToken.secureToken
    )
}
```

And finally the `if` statement in the use case:

```kotlin
// IssueVerificationToken/UseCase.kt

private val OLD_ISSUER = "com.tddfellow"
private val NEW_ISSUER = "https://tddfellow.com"
private val OLD_API_VERSION = "v1"

fun issueVerificationToken(deviceId: String, phoneNumber: String, apiVersion: String): VerificationToken {
    val verificationToken = VerificationToken(
            issuer = getIssuerFor(apiVersion),
            deviceId = deviceId,
            phoneNumber = phoneNumber,
            secureToken = secureTokenSource.generateToken()
    )

    verificationTokenGateway.persist(verificationToken)
    return verificationToken
}

private fun getIssuerFor(apiVersion: String): String {
    if (apiVersion.equals(OLD_API_VERSION)) {
        return OLD_ISSUER
    }
    return NEW_ISSUER
}
```

The full code change available [here (via open Pull Request)](https://github.com/waterlink/LegacyEndpointPrimer/pull/1).

This solution has quite a few problems:

- `if` statement smells a bit
- use case probably should not have any knowledge of `apiVersion`, since APIs is not our domain, it is just a delivery mechanism

If we were to pass some object, like `TokenIssuer`, it would probably be more appropriate to have use case know of it. Let's try to refactor:

## Refactoring `if` Statement Using Polymorphism

First, let's start passing in the token issuer in the routing:

```kotlin
// Main.kt

Spark.get("/api/v1/issueVerificationToken") { request, response ->
    issueVerificationTokenEndpoint.issueVerificationToken(
            deviceId = request.queryParams("deviceId"),
            phoneNumber = request.queryParams("phoneNumber"),

            // here we pass a specific object now for old token issuer:
            tokenIssuer = OldTokenIssuer()
    )
}

Spark.get("/api/v2/issueVerificationToken") { request, response ->
    issueVerificationTokenEndpoint.issueVerificationToken(
            deviceId = request.queryParams("deviceId"),
            phoneNumber = request.queryParams("phoneNumber"),

            // here we pass an object that returns URL according to the standard
            tokenIssuer = UrlTokenIssuer()
    )
}
```

And this is how `TokenIssuer` and its derivatives are looking like:

```kotlin
// IssueVerificationToken/TokenIssuer.kt

interface TokenIssuer {

    fun getName(): String

}
```

```kotlin
// IssueVerificationToken/OldTokenIssuer.kt

class OldTokenIssuer : TokenIssuer {

    override fun getName() = "com.tddfellow"

}
```

```kotlin
// IssueVerificationToken/UrlTokenIssuer.kt

class UrlTokenIssuer : TokenIssuer {

    override fun getName() = "https://tddfellow.com"

}
```

As you might guess, endpoint just passes this object through to the use case. And the use case itself just calls `getName()` on it when generating issuer:

```kotlin
// IssueVerificationToken/UseCase.kt

fun issueVerificationToken(deviceId: String, phoneNumber: String, tokenIssuer: TokenIssuer): VerificationToken {
    val verificationToken = VerificationToken(

            // here is how much simpler it becomes
            issuer = tokenIssuer.getName(),

            deviceId = deviceId,
            phoneNumber = phoneNumber,
            secureToken = secureTokenSource.generateToken()
    )

    verificationTokenGateway.persist(verificationToken)
    return verificationToken
}
```

Full code change can be seen [here (in the Pull Request)](https://github.com/waterlink/LegacyEndpointPrimer/pull/2).

## Bottom Line

This code may be refactored further so that even `Endpoint` class will not have to know about `tokenIssuer` and pass it through. I will leave that as an exercise to you, my dear reader.
