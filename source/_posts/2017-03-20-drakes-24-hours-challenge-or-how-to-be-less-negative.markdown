Did you ever look at the chunk of code that is not very pretty, and immediatelly uttered some bad word or bad remark, such as "Who wrote this?" And not even noticed it?

Or did you ever had an incident happening in production, and half of your vocabulary at that time was not normative? Also, did you feel stressed and down afterwards?

Or did you ever had to converse with a difficult person or someone holding a strong opinion, and thought not very good about them? Or even dismissed a valid argument just because you didn't like the conversation?

Essentially, did you ever felt or did something negative, and thought afterwards that it would be better not to? Then the technique described in this article is perfect for you!

Shall we get the ball rolling?

## Drake's Challenge

About one year ago I was talking to Daniel Irvine (TODO: check the spelling and add the link to blog or twitter) at the Software Craftsmanship meet-up in Berlin about the technique that he was applying daily. I was amazed by how challenging it is and what results it can potentially yield. Since then I'm applying this technique to increase awareness of how I feel, what I think, and what I am about to say.

It gives me ability to respond to events around me instead of reacting to them. Reaction is the immediate reply executed by subconcious part of our brain. Response is the delayed reply executed by concious part of our brain. Responding is much better, because it gives us time to think what would be the best response to the current situation. Especially it is better when something negative or weird is happening around us.

Enough preaching, let me tell you the challenge itself. For twenty-four hours do not say anything negative and do not think negatively.

### How I Apply It

1. Get the stopwatch application running on my smartphone.
2. Start the stopwatch and leave the application in the background.
3. Every time we notice a negative thought or we are saying something negative, reset the stopwatch.

### My Experience So Far
