Hi there! Today I want to share the technique that we are using to improve the collaboration inside of our teams. This technique is most useful in synergy with pairing. It is so powerful that it can remove the tension from our work and make us more productive in two or three days.

First, let me give you some context.

## Pairing ~100% of the Time

At [Pivotal](https://pivotal.io) we pair all the time. It is very rare to see anyone solo. Pairing does not end with pair-programming, it also includes other roles such as design and product. Also, pairing is, at times, cross-functional, e.g.: product designer pairs with software engineer, or product designer pairs with product manager, etc. I personally love that.

With pairing not everything is so shiny.

## Chemistry

Now and then, you need to pair with someone, you have never paired with before. That happens in the event of new hires, team member rotations between teams, and cross-team pairing sessions.

We are all humans, so, from time to time, it feels like you are not getting along very well with your pair. There is certain amount of tension. Of course, that harms your productivity, and, also, drains your energy.
